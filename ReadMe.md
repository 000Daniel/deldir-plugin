## Note before installing
    This script and the plugin should work on any systems with or without dotnet installed. <br />
    The auto install script uses: sudo. <br />
    This script was tested on EndeavourOS(Arch-based), but it should work on other linux systems. <br />
    I do not take any responsibility for any kind of damage this script might cause, <br />
    use it at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
## Installer
    download the `installer.sh` file.<br />
    unpack it in the same directory as the other files. <br />
    enter the next commands into the terminal: <br />
    `sudo chmod +x installer.sh`<br />
    `./installer.sh`<br />
    🞄 after the script installs you should be able to use the deldir command.<br />
<br />
## Manual-Install
    download and unpack the files.<br />
    run in terminal: <br />
    `sudo cp deldir /usr/bin/` <br />
    `sudo cp deldir.pdb /usr/bin/` <br />
    `sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/deldir` <br />
